# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased
- Add `with-vars` macro.
- Add the `quickbin` command to jpm.
- Create shell.c when making the amlagamated source. This can be compiled with
  janet.c to make the janet interpreter.
- Add `cli-main` function to the core, which invokes Janet's CLI interface.
  This basically moves what was init.janet into boot.janet.
- Improve flychecking, and fix flyching bugs introduced in 1.4.0.
- Add `prin`, `eprint`, `eprintf` and `eprin` functions. The
  functions prefix with e print to `(dyn :err stderr)`
- Print family of functions can now also print to buffers
  (before, they could only print to files.) Output can also
  be completely disabled with `(setdyn :out false)`.
- `printf` is now a c function for optimizations in the case
  of printing to buffers.

## 1.4.0 - 2019-10-14
- Add `quit` function to exit from a repl, but not always exit the entire
  application.
- Add `update-pkgs` to jpm.
- Integrate jpm with https://github.com/janet-lang/pkgs.git. jpm can now
  install packages based on their short names in the package listing, which
  can be customized via an env variable.
- Add `varfn` macro
- Add compile time arity checking when function in function call is known.
- Added `slice` to the core library.
- The `*/slice` family of functions now can take nil as start or end to get
  the same behavior as the defaults (0 and -1) for those parameters.
- `string/` functions that take a pattern to search for will throw an error
  when receiving the empty string.
- Replace (start:end) style stacktrace source position information with
  line, column. This should be more readable for humans. Also, range information
  can be recovered by re-parsing source.

## 1.3.1 - 2019-09-21
- Fix some linking issues when creating executables with native dependencies.
- jpm now runs each test script in a new interpreter.
- Fix an issue that prevent some valid programs from compiling.
- Add `mean` to core.
- Abstract types that implement the `:+`, `:-`, `:*`, `:/`, `:>`, `:==`, `:<`,
  `:<=`, and `:>=` methods will work with the corresponding built-in
  arithmetic functions. This means built-in integer types can now be used as
  normal number values in many contexts.
- Allow (length x) on typed arrays an other abstract types that implement
  the :length method.

## 1.3.0 - 2019-09-05
- Add `get-in`, `put-in`, `update-in`, and `freeze` to core.
- Add `jpm run rule` and `jpm rules` to jpm to improve utility and discoverability of jpm.
- Remove `cook` module and move `path` module to https://github.com/janet-lang/path.git.
  The functionality in `cook` is now bundled directly in the `jpm` script.
- Add `buffer/format` and `string/format` format flags `Q` and `q` to print colored and
  non-colored single-line values, similar to `P` and `p`.
- Change default repl to print long sequences on one line and color stacktraces if color is enabled.
- Add `backmatch` pattern for PEGs.
- jpm detects if not in a Developer Command prompt on windows for a better error message.
- jpm install git submodules in dependencies
- Change default fiber stack limit to the maximum value of a 32 bit signed integer.
- Some bug fixes with `jpm`
- Fix bugs with pegs.
- Add `os/arch` to get ISA that janet was compiled for
- Add color to stacktraces via `(dyn :err-color)`

## 1.2.0 - 2019-08-08
- Add `take` and `drop` functions that are easier to use compared to the
  existing slice functions.
- Add optional default value to `get`.
- Add function literal short-hand via `|` reader macro, which maps to the
  `short-fn` macro.
- Add `int?` and `nat?` functions to the core.
- Add `(dyn :executable)` at top level to get what used to be
  `(process/args 0)`.
- Add `:linux` to platforms returned by `(os/which)`.
- Update jpm to build standalone executables. Use `declare-executable` for this.
- Add `use` macro.
- Remove `process/args` in favor of `(dyn :args)`.
- Fix bug with Nanbox implementation allowing users to created
  custom values of any type with typed array and marshal modules, which
  was unsafe.
- Add `janet_wrap_number_safe` to API, for converting numbers to Janets
  where the number could be any 64 bit, user provided bit pattern. Certain
  NaN values (which a machine will never generate as a result of a floating
  point operation) are guarded against and converted to a default NaN value.

## 1.1.0 - 2019-07-08
- Change semantics of `-l` flag to be import rather than dofile.
- Fix compiler regression in top level defs with destructuring.
- Add `table/clone`.
- Improve `jpm` tool with git and dependency capabilities, as well as better
  module uninstalls.

## 1.0.0 - 2019-07-01
- Add `with` macro for resource handling.
- Add `propagate` function so we can "rethrow" signals after they are
  intercepted. This makes signals even more flexible.
- Add `JANET_NO_DOCSTRINGS` and `JANET_NO_SOURCEMAPS` defines in janetconf.h
  for shrinking binary size.
  This seems to save about 50kB in most builds, so it's not usually worth it.
- Update module system to allow relative imports. The `:cur:` pattern
  in `module/expand-path` will expand to the directory part of the current file, or
  whatever the value of `(dyn :current-file)` is. The `:dir:` pattern gets
  the directory part of the input path name.
- Remove `:native:` pattern in `module/paths`.
- Add `module/expand-path`
- Remove `module/*syspath*` and `module/*headerpath*` in favor of dynamic
  bindings `:syspath` and `:headerpath`.
- Compiled PEGs can now be marshaled and unmarshaled.
- Change signature to `parser/state`
- Add `:until` verb to loop.
- Add `:p` flag to `fiber/new`.
- Add `file/{fdopen,fileno}` functions.
- Add `parser/clone` function.
- Add optional argument to `parser/where` to set parser byte index.
- Add optional `env` argument to `all-bindings` and `all-dynamics`.
- Add scratch memory C API functions for auto-released memory on next gc.
  Scratch memory differs from normal GCed memory as it can also be freed normally
  for better performance.
- Add API compatibility checking for modules. This will let native modules not load
  when the host program is not of a compatible version or configuration.
- Change signature of `os/execute` to be much more flexible.

## 0.6.0 - 2019-05-29

- Add `module/loaders` for custom loading functions.
- Add external unification to `match` macro.
- Add static library to main build.
- Add `janet/*headerpath*` and change location of installed headers.
- Let `partition` take strings.
- Haiku OS support
- Add `string/trim`, `string/trimr`, and `string/triml`.
- Add `dofile` function.
- Numbers require at least 1 significant digit.
- `file/read` will return nil on end of file.
- Fix various bugs.

## 0.5.0 - 2019-05-09

- Add `fiber/getenv`, `fiber/setenv`, and `dyn`, and `setdyn`.
- Add support for dynamic bindings (via the `dyn` and `setdyn` functions).
- Change signatures of some functions like `eval` which no longer takes
  an optional environment.
- Add printf function
- Make `pp` configurable with dynamic binding `:pretty-format`.
- Remove the `meta` function.
- Add `with-dyns` for blocks with dynamic bindings assigned.
- Allow leading and trailing newlines in backtick-delimited string (long strings).
  These newlines will not be included in the actual string value.

- Fix a number of smaller bugs
- Added :export option to import and require
- Added typed arrays
- Remove `callable?`.
- Remove `tuple/append` and `tuple/prepend`, which may have seemed like `O(1)`
  operations. Instead, use the `splice` special to extend tuples.

  system modules from.
- Add `-c` flag to main client to allow compiling Janet modules to images.
- Add `string/format` and `buffer/format`.
- Remove `string/pretty` and `string/number`.

- Add partition function to core library.
- Pre-compile core library into an image for faster startup.
- Add methods to parser values that mirror the api.
- Add janet\_getmethod to CAPI for easier use of method like syntax.

- Add debug/stacktrace for easy, pretty stacktraces
- Remove the status-pp function
- Update API to run-context to be much more sane
- Add :lflags option to cook/make-native
